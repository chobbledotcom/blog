Like many British lefties, I check The Guardian website pretty much daily. And I am regularly disappointed by how heavily meat and dairy feature on their homepage and in their "Food" section without any mention of their impact on climate change.

It's especially jarring because of The Guardian's repeated pledges to tell the truth when it comes to the facts of anthropogenic climate change. They make a big song and dance about covering the climate accurately - and they mostly do a good job - so articles about how to make the perfect beef stroganoff or lamb kofta really stick out like sore thumbs when they're presented without any context about the environmental damage caused by making those meals part of your diet.

I wrote to The Guardian's letters page about this a while back, and I never heard anything back - so today I started [this petition asking The Guardian to incorporate climate science into its food section](https://www.change.org/GuardianFood).

I know that Change.org petitions generally have limited success, but you never know. And I'm slightly biased towards optimism there too, after a petition I years ago [asking Guinness to go vegan](https://www.change.org/p/make-guinness-vegetarian-vegan-friendly/) seemed to work - they changed their recipe and [Stephen Colbert shouted out my petition as the reason](https://youtube.com/watch?v=HQlQA67HQhk)!

So on the off chance you're reading this and are similarly annoyed by The Guardian's food sections, please **[sign the petition](https://www.change.org/GuardianFood)** and keep your fingers crossed!
