The BYD Dolphin electric car has a DAB+ and an FM/AM radio, but the FM radio is not in the "DAB+" app on the infotainment system - it's in the "Media Center" one.

This might seem like a pretty odd and specific thing to mention on this blog but it seems like this fact is not readily available elsewhere on the internet.

The other day I spent a frustrating few minutes poking around in the Settings app, and the DAB+ app, trying to figure out how to get the FM tuner working - which the BYD website says exists on all Dolphin models.

So maybe me mentioning the fact that the BYD Dolphin's FM radio is in the "Media Centre" app, which you'd normally only ever open if you wanted to play multimedia files from a USB stick, will save someone else from accidentally pressing the re-scan button on the DAB+ radio - which takes ages.

The analog radio tuner comes with its own favourites system and the audio quality seems decent from my tests. And now that I know how to find the FM/AM radio in the BYD interface, I can use it when the signal is too flaky for DAB or when I want to listen.

If you only remember one thing today, make it this: **If you're looking for the FM radio on your BYD Dolphin's infotainment / dashboard - it's in the "Media Center" app.**

_Addendum: The car is overall really good and great value for money, and while it has some quirks like the FM radio not being in the same place as the DAB+ one in the interface, or the lane-assist or daytime running light preferences not sticking, it's probably a reasonably average amount of quirks and none are that painful._
